# Maintenance

Over time the binary files accumulate such that the git repository gets very large.

The solution is to create another give repository.  Commit just the most recent things.  Got to Settings -> GitHub Pages, a set it serve the /docs directory.

Test that its servers pages correctly, just like the old repository, apart from a slightly different URL.

Then, quickly rename the original repository to something else, rename the new repository to the original repository.

Test, test, test.
